It is 3:00 AM. You just spent the last 6 hours partying and really feeling the effects of it. At first you thought of getting a taxi but you are were so drunk, you couldn’t even call one. 
At this you have given up on making it back home and decided it would be best to go back to your car and sleep there. While you are thinking about the incredibly bad hangover you are going 
to have tomorrow, a weird guy pops out of nowhere and tells you something about a weird hole in the wall. You look around but can’t seem to get a good grasp on your surroundings. Noticing this 
the weird man grabs you by the arm and tries to drag you along.
-
You obviously aren’t thinking straight but how could you? You are literally so drunk it is a miracle you haven’t gone into a coma yet. As he brings you closer, you realize that
there is in fact a hole in the wall. Wouldn’t you look at that? Seems like you won’t be kidnapped. Especially since the police just showed up. Wait, what? The police? What are they doing here? 
Well, they aren’t messing around because the second they saw, they started shooting.
You make a run for it towards the hole along with the random stranger you just met. Unfortunately the stranger gets shot and falls down. Worried, you turn around only to see him charge at you like a bull.
-
You try to resist but the stranger gets aggressive and forces you to come with him. Maybe it’s because of how drunk you are but he seems ridiculously strong. Seconds
after the police show and start shooting. The stranger tries to run away but you stop him in his tracks allowing the police to shoot him. 
Somehow the stranger is still alive and grabs you as a hostage. As the blood from his arm touches yours, you feel a lot more sober and somehow stronger. You look at your arm and see that it is turning 
black. With this newfound strength you beat the hell out of him. The police, surprised, arrest you and bring you to the police HQ for questioning.
-
Damn! Look at those skills. Even though you were so drunk, you managed to perfectly dodge the weird stranger/creature in order to land right in front of the police, who killed just about instantly. GAME OVER.
-
As much as you wouldn’t like to get hit by something like that, if you dodge, you’ll end up in front of the police which currently seems like a bad idea so instead you just stand still. The stranger 
who at this point looks more like a creature from hell pushes you into the hole and knocks you out after you hitting you on the head. As you wake up, you see that you are in a black reflective room. 
The creature is right besides you, lying on a pool of his own blood and dead. Meanwhile, you feel a lot more sober and somehow stronger. As you look down, you realize that you have got a new pure black 
eye. Did the creature do that? Out of nowhere a voice tells you to go left.
-
You decide to tell them everything. It seems like they don’t really care about your story but your arm caught their interest. They bring you to a doctor and do a few small tests on you. After they 
analyze the results, they put a bag over your head and bring you to the basement.The basement is completely different from the police HQ. It almost looks like a hightech villain hideout. You can see 
that some people of the military are also there. Just as you try to ask a question, a man shows and starts a presentation. 'Three months ago an unknown space station appeared out of nowhere. 
This space station has its own gravitational force which should be impossible for something as small as that. As NASA came closer to said space station, the space ship began to experience unknown 
difficulties. At the end of the day, only one astronaut came back but he had lost his sanity and exchanged his body for the black substance which currently lies on your arm. The only info we 
could get out of him was that the black goop was the only way to stay “whole” and that the space station had an orb which controlled the gravitational force of the space station and the black 
substance. 24 hours later the black goop swallowed him whole and disappeared, presumably killing him. This means that we both have something to offer. You are the perfect candidate for 
retrieving the orb and you need the orb to survive. How about it?' Before you can say anything your arm starts to hurt and you hear a voice telling you to use the black goop to read their minds.
-
You are feeling weird. The black stuff on your arm is definitely not normal and the strength that you have obtained with it is neither. Although you are very concerned about it, you can not 
afford to let this people know so you act as drunk as possible and hope for the best. They don’t suspect a thing and lock you up in a cell for the night. In the middle of the night you feel 
an incredible amount of pain before being swallowed by your arm, killing you instantly. GAME OVER
-
You decide to do as the voice says and go left. Unfortunately, you didn’t realize in time that it was a recording and end up stuck in a room. As you look around, you see a ton of clones of 
yourself except that they are all in different states of decay. Realizing what this implies, you rush to break the door, only to exhaust yourself and close your eyes for the last time ever. GAME OVER
-
You can’t just trust a random voice so easily so you decide to explore the right path before going left. Suddenly a light flashes and you find yourself in a garden inside a futuristic building. You look 
back and see that the black room is no longer there. You go to the center of the garden and see a panel there with different options.
-
This black goop sounds evil so there is no way you are going to do what it says, you tell the people there that you are willing to cooperate with them and that you would like to begin the mission as 
soon as possible. Upon hearing this the general brings you to a room to prepare for space flight and piloting. As much of a hurry you are in, this is an important step so you can’t help but doing it. 
Little did you know the whole thing was a lie and that they brought you to another room to make you lose consciousness with a gas and then operate on you to extract the black goop. Of course 
the operation killed you. GAME OVER
-
You are quite surprised by the information that you find out by reading their mind. The whole operation is a lie and they plan on killing you and extracting the black goop from your arm. You 
immediately go in a defensive stance and demand that they send you to space or else you will kill every person there. Reading their minds gained you a psychological advantage so pressuring 
them to do it was easy. 24 hours later you are in space near the space station. From the outside you can see the orb which you need to retrieve. Perhaps after all of this everything will be 
solved easily or at least that’s what you thought before seeing the orb rise and start to power up.
-
You assume that this is connected to an elevator so you press descend. You don’t really know where the elevator is but the sound should give it away. Suddenly the entire garden begins shaking 
and you can feel yourself fall faster and faster. A few minutes later you can see how the entire building glows yellow and falls apart. Seconds before impact you see the Earth and realize you 
were on a space station. GAME OVER
-
It looks like the panel is on sleep mode or something like that so you press power up. The panel displays a loading bar and an orb rises from the ground. As you begin to question what exactly 
you just did a bunch of creatures like the stranger appear and you make run for it. Not to long after the rob pulsates and everything multiplies. You see countless Earths below you and the 
hallway divides into 100 different ones. Most of them are the same except for two. In one of them you can see yourself and in the other some people with lab coats.
-
It is now or never. You go as fast as you can towards the space station and try to slow down when you are near but the controls are all messed up. The buttons are multiplying and you have no idea 
what is real and what isn’t. You collide with the space station and see countless copies of yourself. Everything explodes but you find yourself in the garden just fine. The black goop on your arm 
grows across your chest causing massive pain. You take a breather and look at the panel in front of you.
-
The space station disappears along with your space ship. You freeze to death in space. GAME OVER
-
The impulse ends and the hallway returns to normal. You didn’t manage to catch u to the people but you are in the same hallway as they were. You walk forward and out and see that you are in a far 
bigger space station than the last one except that this is far more suited for living in with buildings, restaurants, markets, etc. You don’t really understand how but you don’t bother to question it. 
The black eye goop on your eye grows across your face causing massive pain. You take a breather and ask somebody where you are. Upon hearing the person looks alerted and calls somebody.
-
You run as fast as you can but don’t quite make it. The impulse ends and out of nowhere a space ship crashes into the space station and everything explodes. Before dying you see yourself in 
the space ship. GAME OVER
-
The space station begins to descend at an even pace. At this rate you should be capable of bringing back the orb to Earth without any problem. Thinking of Earth, you look outside in order to see its beauty 
in space but instead are confronted with a bizarre sight. The Earth is surrounded by a ring. To top it all off, you hear the sound of footsteps, meaning that there is someone else here.
-
You don’t really know what warping does but you have a sneaking suspicion that you warped during the explosion so if you want to bring back the orb home, you’ll have to warp. Suddenly your arm grows 
and swallows your whole body turning you into one of the creatures. After that you no longer are aware of your actions. GAME OVER
-
You go ahead and tell them the name of the people you saw in the corridor, the normal civilian looks at you in confusion but the police who he had just called, look at you dead serious and bring you to 
the upper floor. There a man introduces himself as head scientist and begins to explain the story of the space station. A long time ago Earth was reaching the limit of its resources but the people in power 
were obsessed with progress and new weapons in order to steal resources from each other. Ironically this was the thing that saved them. A scientist found new uses of a stone which was thought to be useless 
up until then. With that stone he was capable of bending time and space to his will but he overused the stone. The stone broke in two parts: The space orb and the time orb. To top it all of, the space 
became permanently active, shattering dimensions by the second and the scientist. The black goop on your body is in fact part of the scientist which now exists in every dimension as weird space bending 
creatures. Even though the space orb was broken, the people of that dimension used the time orb to remove all the fissures that the orb created and redirect them to other dimensions. Because of that 
every single Earth of all the other dimensions is slowly being broken but there is a way to stop it. Since you have part of the scientist on you, the space orb can’t destroy you, because you technically 
exist on infinite dimensions and thus infinite space. If you can go into the origin dimension with and combine the space and time orb, this entire ordeal might be over. You will have to go to the origin 
dimension and use the space orb to gain access to the time orb and finish it. In order to go there we can use these other version of you as a portal to the original dimension.
-
You try to fake an illness in order to cover up your eye. Unfortunately seems like the question was a far bigger problem than the eye since he keeps on calling for help. You see the police coming and 
try to fight them off but they are literally shooting 100 of bullets per second at you. You manage to run into an alleyway but bleed to death. GAME OVER
-
You can’t just ignore somebody else in the space station. You still don’t know anything about the origin of the space station and why the stranger in the parking lot had the black goop. You go down a hallway 
and see somebody. You hide behind a crate after getting a glimpse of his/her face. You don’t know who it is but you do see the fact that they have an eye with black goop and that is reason enough for you to fight. 
You rush to fight them with your new powers but struggle to finish him off. Thankfully it seems like his specialty is long range attack and you are too close for that. You kill him and finally get a good look at his face. 
This person was actually you. As you regret what you have just done, the eye crawls and attaches itself to you. You lose consciousness and never wake up again. GAME OVER
-
The sound was far away and you would rather hide than actively look for the sound. First you change the path to the palace on the ring and then hide. You are surprised to see that it’s you who made the 
sound. He explains that the orb in the space station is the space orb which is currently malfunctioning and breaking dimensions. He is supposedly another version of you from another dimension. In order 
to fix we have to go to the palace and fuse it with the orb of time. That way the black goop should also be cured. You still have questions but he tells just tells you to play the other route. Your 
talk is cut short by attacks from the palace.
-
You use the other goop on your clone to open a portal to the origin dimension. Obviously this worsens the goop but it isn’t anything you can’t handle. You appear at the space station. You can tell 
that the space station is moving because of the vibrations. You hurry to the panel, preparing yourself for a fight but don’t find anybody there . As you approach the panel another version of you 
pops out of nowhere and asks you what you are doing there. You explain the whole story and he tells you his. You are currently going towards the space palace in which the time orb is. Before you 
realize it, the palace guards are shooting at you and the worse part is that the other you is going to use the space orb as a shield!
-
You don’t have to believe what these people say. In fact, you shouldn’t. That is what you think to yourself as you let the machine extract the eye out of you and open a portal to your dimension. 
You jump through and expect to land on the garden but end up in the emptiness of space, dead like everything else there. GAME OVER 
-
You use the space orb as shield against the longrange weapons while your other you takes care of the melee guards. These people should know how dangerous shooting this thing would be, right? They do indeed
 stop shooting but as you land the impact goes through you to the orb and activates it again. The orb breaks the palace apart and worsens your arm. You lose your footing because of the pain and fall through 
the cracks that the orb just caused.
-
Your massive arm reflects all the missiles and bullets with ease. You are almost scared by how strong you are. You kill most of the guards but then the creatures appear. Apparently the orb broke after 
crashlanding. You are no match against such an army and both of you die. GAME OVER
-
Using the space orb is madness! If that thing breaks, who knows what will happen to this universe? You know this is bad timing but you start to argue with the other you and eventually the argument escalates 
to a fight. The guards take advantage and shoot both of you down. GAME OVER
-
You reluctantly agree and decide to instead help him. While he takes care of the guards with guns, you’ll beat the other ones up and make a path to the center. What you didn’t calculate is that the impact 
of the landing would be enough to trigger the space orb. The space station breaks apart and tears apart. Fortunately you make it to a platform but the other you doesn’t.
-
You arm is capable of stretching quite a bit already so if you were to trigger the orb once again, your arm will become long enough to reach the palace. Of course, we both know this is a stupid idea. 
You use the orb and destroy the entire palace. With no palace you can’t help but to fall all the way to the Earth and die. GAME OVER
-
As a last attempt you try to use some kind of telekinesis or power that could allow you to make it to safety. Magically it works and you see a platform moving towards you. You run towards the 
center of the palace where the time orb is but in the way there you see the boss of the security guards running away. Perhaps you should capture him for future use?
-
You jump down to save your other you but already has saved himself using his powers. You end up being pushed further down and combust in the atmosphere of the Earth. GAME OVER
-
As bad as you feel leaving him like that, you have your priorities. You run to the room which has the time orb. The guards don’t bother you since they are trying to save themselves. 
Creatures start appearing from around the room which holds the time orb. You fight through them and get into the room. In there is a scientist and the other you. You see a countdown on the screen. 
The scientist explains that the orb is charging up to undo everything that has happened in the last 20 years. Of course, everything will be repeated again and we’ll all end up in the same place in 20 years. 
It is an infinite loop designed so that nobody can fuse the two orbs and endanger the Earth of this dimension. The only way of stopping it would be to reunite a big chunk of the black goop and let it be destroyed. 
In order to do this one of you would have to absorb the black goop on each other and then basically let themselves be destroyed. Suddenly the other you tells you that he will sacrifice himself and to give him your eye.
-
You go after the security guard and beat him up. This process takes ling enough for the creatures surrounding the core to notice you and go after you. With your strength you can beat them up pretty 
easily but at one point there is a flash of light which ends everything. GAME OVER.
-
You literally have reality breaking powers so you don’t think there is anything that the security guard could do for you. You keep on running while the palace falls apart. You make it to the room which 
holds the time orb and see a countdown. Your other you comes in seconds after you. The scientist explains that the orb is charging up to undo everything that has happened in the last 20 years. Of 
course, everything will be repeated again and we’ll all end up in the same place in 20 years. It is an infinite loop designed so that nobody can fuse the two orbs and endanger the Earth of this dimension. 
The only way of stopping it would be to reunite a big chunk of the black goop and let it be destroyed. In order to do this one of you would have to absorb the black goop on each other and then 
basically let themselves be destroyed. After hearing this you look at yourself and see into what you have turned. The black goop has taken over half of your body and you barely look 
human. You take a deep breatsh and decide to…
-
Why would you listen to your enemy? You use your eye to defend yourself and merge the time orb with the space orb. You thought it would be a question of pushing them together hard enough 
but that ends up being wrong. You accidentally destroy the time orb and everything fades. You end up in the dark room from before and are uncapable of getting out. You stay there forever 
and eventually rot away but still live. During this eternal torture you encounter past versions of yourself and try to convince them to go the wrong way and thus enjoy death. Ending 1.
-
You can feel the determination in his words. You rip out your eye and give it to him. With the power of the eye he swallows all the creatures and becomes completely engulfed in black goop. 
He combines the time orb and the space orb. You open your eyes and wake up in the garden all over again. You look at your reflection on the glass and see that you no longer have your left 
eye but the goop is gone. As you actually bother to look through the window you see your Earth with the ring and the palace around it. Apparently your other you managed to fuse all the 
good stuff from all dimensions into one. Ending 2 (True ending)
-
You can’t do it. At the end of the day, you are human and you want to live. You tell the other you to do it and although he argues with you, he accepts. Problem is that you have to 
give him your arm but you can’t rip off your arm. While you are struggling the creatures break in and kill the other you. In a desperate attempt to save yourself, you use the time orb and travel 
back in time. You feel pathetic and a coward for doing this but you see your chance for redemption. You see yourself drunk in a parking lot and do exactly what you have to do. Ending 3
-
You absorb the eye and with its power you absorb the creatures. You feel immense pain and can barely think but you manage to fuse the time orb and the space orb. The time orb releases 
its energy on you and shreds you apart but you use the space orb to combine yourself with both orbs thus allowing you to escape death and live inside the orb. You become the guardian of the space 
and time orb and control all dimensions. Ending 4.
